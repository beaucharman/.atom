This gives the UI a coherent feel, with whatever syntax theme you like to use. I used [Behave](https://atom.io/themes/behave-theme) in the screenshot below.\n\n![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/j7Vrom5.png)\n\n#### Support\n[Buy me a coffee to keep me going](https://www.paypal.me/ignism)\n\n#### Installation\nInside atom go to settings, select Install and search for Nucleus.\n\nOr install directly from the console:\n\n`apm install nucleus-dark-ui`\n\n#### Requirements\nEvery color used in the UI is taken directly from a (dark) syntax theme. In order for this to work, the syntax theme needs to have a `syntax-variables.less`. A light version of this theme is still being worked on.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/ignism/nucleus-dark-ui/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/ignism/nucleus-dark-ui#readme","_id":"nucleus-dark-ui@0.12.3","_shasum":"41f14844c2ae582bab548ae95ea7d2a275ac1ddd","_resolved":"file:../d-117615-48770-16ia6s1.fv1hwoecdi/package.tgz","_from":"../d-117615-48770-16ia6s1.fv1hwoecdi/package.tgz"}
