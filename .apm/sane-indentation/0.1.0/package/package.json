The main difference betweenthe logic in this package and in the\n[language-mode](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/src/language-mode.coffee)\npackage (where the identation logic resides in atom) is that this package does a\nstrict count of opening and closing scopes and uses the tokenizer to identify\nwhether scope delimiters appear in a string or comment (in which case they are\nignored -- which seems sane). Hence the resulting indentation will never get out\nof wack, meaning that the identation does not grow arbitrarily for longer files --\nsomething that sometimes happens with the existing logic.\n\nThis package is transitional. Once we can come to an agreement on how to move\nforward with this in atom/atom this package will go away.\n\n<!-- ![A screenshot of your package](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/69169/2290250/c35d867a-a017-11e3-86be-cd7c5bf3ff9b.gif) -->\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/chfritz/atom-sane-indentation/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/chfritz/atom-sane-indentation#readme","_id":"sane-indentation@0.1.0","_shasum":"82c52b281b62feb8a74ffe4d647279b97d6c7d29","_resolved":"file:../d-1161015-20087-u2g1xp/package.tgz","_from":"../d-1161015-20087-u2g1xp/package.tgz"}
