It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.\n\n## Language support\n\nDuoTone themes are optimized for many languages:\n\n> C, Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, CSS, GF Markdown, Go, Haskell, HTML, Java, JavaScript, JSON, Less, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby, SASS, SCSS, Stylus, XML, YAML...\n\nSee the list of [all languages](/styles/languages).\n\n\n## Variations\n\nHere is a list of all [DuoTone themes](https://atom.io/themes/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=keyword:duotone)- well, at least the ones that have the `duotone` keyword added. :grin:\n\n\n### Issues and contributing\n\nIf you would like to create a new __Issue__ or __PR__, please do so in:\n\n- __this repo__ if it's about __color__ changes, like in `colors.less` or `syntax-variables.less`.\n- __[DuoTone master template](https://github.com/simurai/duotone-syntax)__ if it's about __everything else__, like in improving language support. Changes will trickle down into this theme too.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/bynines/duotone-dark-amethyst-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/bynines/duotone-dark-amethyst-syntax#readme","_id":"duotone-dark-amethyst-syntax@2.0.4","_shasum":"e2f2e6a6e5e5f0b5a1a2914f2e646d4301a4e964","_resolved":"file:../d-116108-92414-183by12/package.tgz","_from":"../d-116108-92414-183by12/package.tgz"}
