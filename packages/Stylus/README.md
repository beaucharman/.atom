# Stylus language support in Atom (with extra snippets)

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to Stylus files in Atom.

Originally [converted](http://atom.io/docs/latest/converting-a-text-mate-bundle) from the [Stylus TextMate bundle](https://github.com/vgrichina/Stylus.tmbundle) and [Stylus Plus bundle](https://github.com/jackbrewer/stylus-plus.tmbundle).

Massive hat-tip to https://github.com/billymoon/Stylus for a lot of the regex values.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
