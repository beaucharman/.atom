DuoTone dark amethyst uses only 2 hues (purple & another purple ;) and has 7 shades in total. It __tones down__ less important parts (like punctuation and brackets) and highlights only the __important__ ones. This leads to a more calm color scheme, but still lets you find the stuff you're looking for.
